# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Runs the app.\
Open [zacklow28quoteadvice](https://zacklow28quoteadvice.netlify.app/) to view it in your browser.

The page has a simple UI that displays a quote and an advice component. When the buttons to get new quotes or advice are clicked, new data is fetched from the API and displayed on the page.
